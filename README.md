## Description

In this application I worked on turning this application into a Progressive Web app(PWA). You will find that it works offline, is installable and bundles the necessary files. This allows user to use the application in various situations, providing great client experience whether the app is installed or the user has lost connection. You will be able to keep taking notes or writing your code to save for later.

## Installation
In the root of your application in your terminal be sure to Install all necessary packages like so `npm install`. Still being in the root of your folder you can `npm run build`, or `npm start` depending on how you want to view the application.

While you are in the application just click the install button on the top left and you will be able to install the app. If you are on google chrome and want to access it type this into your url in the browser. `chrome://apps/`  

## Deployed Application
